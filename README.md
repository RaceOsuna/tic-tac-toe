# Tic Tac Toe 

### Abstract: 
This web application allows for two players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. The top banner diplays which player's turn it currently is. When a player clicks on a space that space is then updated to show that players game piece(that space can no longer be selected). The game then switches to then next players turn and the process is repeated. Each time a token is placed on the board the game checks for a winning condition or draw condition. If no conditions are met then the came can continue to be played. In the case of a draw the top banner will update to diplay it's a draw. In the case of a win, the top banner will update to display "(token of winning player) Wins!" as well as udating and diplaying each players total wins on the side bars. In both cases the gameboard is automatically reset to begin playing a new game.
