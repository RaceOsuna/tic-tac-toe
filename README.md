# Tic Tac Toe 

### Abstract: 
This web application allows for two players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. The top banner diplays which player's turn it currently is. When a player clicks on a space that space is then updated to show that players game piece(that space can no longer be selected). The game then switches to then next players turn and the process is repeated. Each time a token is placed on the board the game checks for a winning condition or draw condition. If no conditions are met then the came can continue to be played. In the case of a draw the top banner will update to diplay it's a draw. In the case of a win, the top banner will update to display "(token of winning player) Wins!" as well as udating and diplaying each players total wins on the side bars. In both cases the gameboard is automatically reset to begin playing a new game.

### Context: 
This is my final solo project for Mod 1 of the Turing program. I am 5 weeks into the program.

### Learning Goals: 
- Solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
-  DRY JavaScript
-  event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on  the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
- Win: Completing this project! 5 weeks ago this didnt seem possible
- Win: Gain more knowledge of CSS
- Win: Have a better understanding of DOM manipulation and event delegation
- Challenge: Finding the best way to check for win/draw condition. There may not be a best way, but it think I took the simplest approach.
- Challenge: Creating the gameboard. This is where I gained knowledge of CSS and grids.
- Challenge: Disabling squares and making sure certain elements were't clickable.

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
